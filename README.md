# Men4Man

This project aims to create a web platform focused on supporting men's mental health in Kenya. It will provide a safe space for men to share their challenges anonymously or openly, access peer support, and connect with counselors. The platform aims to tackle stigma surrounding men's mental health by offering resources tailored to their needs. By fostering a supportive community and providing accessible mental health services, the project aims to empower men to address their mental well-being effectively.
